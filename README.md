# pulsar_detection
Pulsars are highly magnetised, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation which are detectable on Earth. Detecting pulsars and accurately characterising their properties has been important in modern astronomy and physics for calculating cosmic distances and testing Einstein’s theory of relativity. Further analysis of these dead stars can potentially answer or test other questions and theories about our universe through strong-field gravitational experiments. This research investigates the efficacy of five classification models for pulsar detection in radio astronomy, using the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (HTRU2) dataset. The aim being to identify the most effective approach for distinguishing pulsar signals from background noise within observational data. These classification models being logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour, decision tree, and random forest. Once trained they are evaluated based on the chosen performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
